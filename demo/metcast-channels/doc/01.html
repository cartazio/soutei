    <h1 align=center>Demo Scenario</h1>

    <p>We demonstrate Soutei integrated with Navy Enterprise Single Sign-On
    (NESSO) and Metcast Channels.  We include examples of
    <em>delegation</em> and <em>Risk Adaptable Access Control
        (RAdAC)</em>.</p>

    <img alt="communication diagram" src="soutei.png">

    <p>Our initial policy states that:

    <ul>
        <li>sam.sysadmin may delegate permission to create channels.
        <li>The creator of a channel may delegate access to his channel.
        <li>All access is delegated to the emergency policy.
    </ul>
    </p>
