Soutei, a logic-based trust-management system
Andrew Pimlott and Oleg Kiselyov

Soutei is a trust-management system, a dialect of Binder, for access
control in distributed systems. Soutei policies and credentials are
written in a declarative logic-based security language and thus
constitute distributed logic programs. Soutei policies are modular,
concise, and readable. They support policy verification, and, despite
the simplicity of the language, express role- and attribute-based
access control lists, and conditional delegation.
